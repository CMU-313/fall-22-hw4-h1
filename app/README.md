We utilized 6 metrics through the entire process: G1, G2, G3, studytime, absences, Dalc.

Since CMU considers a high-quality student one with a G3 grade of 15 or higher, we used this metric to label whether or not a student was admitted. We then dropped this metric from the table so that we were left with the remaining five: G1, G2, studytime, absences, Dalc. We trained and built the model based on these five and got an F1 score of 0.993197. The F1 score from the original model was .5, and considering an F1 score closer to 1 indicates better predictors, our new F1 score proved our improved model was effective. The F1 score indicates that our first metric, G3, and our remaining 5 metrics, (G1, G2, activites, studytime, absences, Dalc) had similar results in predicting which students would be accepted into the college.
